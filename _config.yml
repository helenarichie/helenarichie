user_description: I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh in the Department of Physics & Astronomy. My interests include observational astronomy and exoplanet detection.

I earned my B.Sc. in Physics & Astronomy and Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh from 2016-2020. During that time, I served as Lead Undergraduate of the Survey of Transiting Extrasolar Planets at the University of Pittsburgh (STEPUP), which is an observational astronomy group that uses instruments based out of Pittsburgh's <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~aobsvtry/">Allegheny Observatory</a> to detect transiting exoplanets.
