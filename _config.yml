user_description: I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh studying physics & astronomy and mathematics. I am the lead undergraduate of a research group in Pittâ€™s Physics & Astronomy Department known as the Survey of Transiting Extrasolar Planets at the University of Pittsburgh (STEPUP). Members of this group use resources based out of the Allegheny Observatory to detect exoplanets via the transit photometry method. Outside of studying physics and astronomy, I enjoy yoga, traveling, and trying new food!
